> You can also choose to avoid the conversational creation experience by selecting **Skip to configure**. You can set the agent's primary language in the **Edit language** menu. For the lab, be sure to remain in English (en-US). It's best practice to always configure your agent in the context of your own solution and publisher, so that the agent is created with the desired publisher prefix, and so you can easily export the agent and deploy it to other environments.

# Task 01: Set up

## Introduction

Contoso has decided to adopt an AI-driven customer support solution to address increasing customer demands and reduce the workload on customer service representatives. To start implementing this solution, you first need to set up the required environment within the Power Platform. This task involves preparing the necessary foundational components such as Dataverse, enabling you to build the AI-powered agent effectively.

## Description

In this task, you’ll configure the Power Platform environment by enabling Microsoft Dataverse and deploying sample apps and data. These components provide the essential foundation for creating and deploying intelligent agents with Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## Success criteria

-   You navigated to the Power Platform admin center and signed in with the provided Microsoft 365 credentials.
-   You selected the correct environment ("Contoso (default)") and enabled Dataverse with sample apps and data.


## Navigate the lab environment


**The Type Text icon**  

![hut7bsbc.jpg](instructions274352/hut7bsbc.jpg)

Select the icon in the instructions and the Type Text feature will automatically send the specified text to the active window in the virtual machine.  
 
Always compare the text in the instructions with the typed text in the virtual machine to verify that the expected text displays. 

For larger code blocks, use the **Copy** button and then paste the text by right-clicking or using **CTRL+V** in the virtual machine.

**Lab credentials**  
The credentials required for accessing the virtual environment and the lab-supplied Microsoft 365 tenant are always available at the top of this instructions pane under the **Resources** tab. 

---

**Saving your progress**  
To save your progress, select **Exit Lab** in the upper-right corner of the screen, then select **Save Progress and Exit**. This will ensure that your work is preserved for future sessions.

{: .warning } Selecting **End Lab** will terminate the lab without saving.

---

**Images**   

All images in the lab instructions are clickable. By selecting them, you can open a zoomed-in view in a separate window for better clarity and analysis. 
 
--- 

**Split Windows feature**  
If you're equipped with multiple screens, you can use the Split Windows feature to place the lab instructions on a separate screen, making better use of your screen real estate. 

To enable this feature:  
1. Select the **cogwheel** icon in the upper-right corner of this pane.  
2. Select **Split Windows** at the bottom of the **Settings** pane.

This will help you keep the virtual machine and instructions visible simultaneously for a more efficient workflow.

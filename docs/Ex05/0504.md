> **Pro tips**:  
>  - When using the default built-in natural language understanding model, knowledge sources are invoked from the **Create generative answers** node. By default, user sentences that don't trigger a topic will go to the **Conversational boosting** topic, where a **Generative answers** node is pre-configured.  
>  - When generative AI orchestration is enabled, the large language model will look at each knowledge source model description to know what data source to use to answer a user query.

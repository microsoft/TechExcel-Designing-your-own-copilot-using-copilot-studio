# Exercise 05: Implement knowledge sources

## Scenario

As Contoso's knowledge base grows, the team wants the agent to tap into multiple authoritative sources - web pages, internal SharePoint sites, OneDrive documents, and Dataverse tables - so customers always receive accurate, grounded answers. In this exercise you'll configure these knowledge sources, test them, and learn how Copilot Studio uses retrieval‑augmented generation to cite each source in chat.

## Objectives

After this exercise you'll be able to:

- Make your agent instantly smart by pointing to your website and other knowledge sources.
- Navigate to the Generative AI settings.
- Navigate to the Conversational Boosting system topic.
- Set custom prompt instructions.

## Duration

Estimated time: 30 minutes

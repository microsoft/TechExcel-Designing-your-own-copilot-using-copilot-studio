# Exercise 05: Leverage knowledge sources, AI knowledge, and custom instructions


## Goals for this lab

After this lab you will be able to:  
- Make your bot instantly smart by pointing to your website and other knowledge sources. 
- Navigate to the Generative AI settings  
- Navigate to the Conversational Boosting system topic  
- Set custom prompt instructions

## Architecture

## Duration

Estimated time: *30 minutes*.

## Knowledge sources

Knowledge in Microsoft Copilot Studio allows you to add enterprise data from Power Platform, Dynamics 365, and external systems, so your agents can provide relevant information and insights for your end users. In addition, knowledge can be incorporated with generative answers in agents. Published agents that contain knowledge use the configured knowledge sources to ground themselves.

Supported knowledge sources

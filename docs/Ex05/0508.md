# Task 08: Use AI general knowledge

## Introduction

In addition to knowledge sources, you can use AI general knowledge to allow your agent to find and present information in response to customer questions. General knowledge saves you from needing to manually author multiple topics, which may not address all customer questions.

This capability allows the agent to try and answer questions with its own knowledge, outside of any grounding data from your knowledge sources, like asking questions to ChatGPT.

With the built-in, default, natural language understanding model, any user utterance that does not trigger a topic goes to the **Conversational boosting** topic.

Like any other topic, the logic in the **Conversational boosting** topic can be configured to further meet your scenarios.

# Task 03: (Optional) Use Power Apps to upload a pre-built Copilot 

1.	In **[MS Power Apps](make.powerapps.com)** you can (optionally) import a Copilot to use as a starting point for your lab exercises. You will need one of our Zip files called **TechExcel_1.0.0.1.Zip** available as a separate download. You can download the .zip file from the root of this repo. To import this Copilot select **Solutions** in the left pane.

    <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Designing-your-own-copilot-using-copilot-studio/blob/main/TechExcel_1_0_0_1.zip">TechExcel_1.0.0.1.Zip<a>

# Task 01: Add on a trial of Power Platform

{: .important }
> For those who are building a demo environment using CDX, you can start with a 90 day M365 trial. Start by going to **[CDX](cdx.transform.microsoft.com)** and select **My Environments**. Select **Create Tenant** on the first option *Microsoft M365 Enterprise demo content*, accept the disclaimer,  and wait for the provisioning.  You will then get a new M365 tenant in **My Environments**. Open an In Private browser, sign in to *Office.com* with the new credentials and activate multi factor authentication (MFA).  Consult your instructor if you need support.

# Summary

This is a pre-requisite to performing these exercises using your own M365 account as a base.  Once you build a Copilot Studio sandbox using these steps you will be able to demonstrate Copilot Studio to your customers.

{:.note } 
> This can only be used to design Custom Copilots.  
> 
> It will not have the ability to work with Agents or to extend M365 Copilot as you will need an M365 Copilot license.  
> 
> In order to demonstrate the ability to create Agents you will need to use the special “demo tenant for Copilot” that is only available for MW and Copilot seller roles.

## Task 01: Use entities and slot filling

### Introduction

To enhance your agent's ability to efficiently handle common inquiries from Contoso's customers, you'll import content directly from Contoso's existing website. This task helps the agent leverage accurate, consistent, and already-approved customer service information, streamlining responses to frequent customer requests.

### Description

In this task, you'll use Microsoft Copilot Studio to import content from a website. Copilot Studio analyzes the webpage content and generates suggested conversational topics automatically, reducing manual content creation.

Microsoft Copilot Studio uses natural language understanding (NLU) to interpret what a user is saying to try and match a user's utterance with an existing topic. NLU can also help the agent identify **entities** in a user's input. 

An entity represents key information you're trying to extract from a sentence and then saves it for later use.


### Example scenario

If the user enters "I want fifty red coffee machines" the agent can understand that:

- "**Fifty**" is the number "50" and it's also the number of products to purchase.
- "**Red**" is a color and is the color of the products to purchase.
- "**Coffee machine**" refers to the product that the person wants to purchase.


### Success criteria

- You've successfully imported topics from the provided website.
- You've reviewed and confirmed the topics created from the imported content.

#### 03: Test slot filling

To confirm the accuracy of information collection from customers, you'll test the slot filling capabilities of your agent. This helps ensure that the agent correctly identifies and stores critical details from customer interactions for Contoso's service requests.

1. In the **Test your agent** pane, select **Start new test session** to start a new conversation.

	![m0pvlkoq.jpg](../../media/m0pvlkoq.jpg)

	```
	Can I check on an order?
	```

1. On the command bar for the agent, select **Variables**.

1. In the **Variables** pane, select **Test** and then select **Topic**.

	![evdk47kt.jpg](../../media/evdk47kt.jpg)

	{: .note }
	> You'll see the process is working because the user has triggered this topic with the intent to check an order, and the entity has been slot filled into the variable from the follow-up question after the trigger phrase.
	> 
	> As a result, the question is not asked and is skipped. This is because you used entities and slot filling to retrieve the information from the utterance the user submitted.

# Task 06: Use variables in conditions

## Introduction

To provide tailored responses based on customer input, Contoso’s agent must utilize conditions based on stored data. In this task, you'll configure conversation conditions using variables to dynamically guide the conversation according to specific scenarios.

## Description

In this task, you’ll set conditions in conversational topics based on variable values, directing the conversation flow appropriately depending on user inputs or previously collected information.

## Success criteria

-   You’ve created conditional logic based on variable values.
-   You’ve tested and confirmed correct conversational branching based on variables.

    `Let me check on that order for you.`

    `No problem. Give me just a moment to cancel that order.`

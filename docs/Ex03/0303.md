# Task 03: Call your Power Automate cloud flow from Copilot Studio

## Introduction

To enhance Contoso’s customer interactions, the agent needs to integrate seamlessly with automated processes. By connecting conversational topics to Power Automate cloud flows, the agent will dynamically fetch and provide customers with relevant information in real-time.

## Description

In this task, you’ll integrate your previously created Power Automate cloud flow with the conversational topic in Microsoft Copilot Studio. You’ll configure the flow invocation and pass collected customer inputs to automate the process of information retrieval.

## Success criteria

-   You’ve linked your conversational topic to the Power Automate cloud flow.
-   You’ve correctly configured topic variables to pass inputs to the flow.
-   You’ve verified through testing that the integration works correctly.


## Key tasks

### 01: Call your Power Automate cloud flow from Copilot Studio

<!--
1. Go back to your tab for Copilot Studio.

1. In the **Save and refresh** dialog, select **Done** to update the flow list with the one you just created. You can also manually refresh the page.

	![b84p7yfo.jpg](../../media/b84p7yfo.jpg)

1. If needed, select the **+** button under the **Question** node again, select **Add an Action**, then select the **Get Ticket Status (@lab.User.FirstName @lab.User.LastName)** flow.

	![vr59wkix.jpg](../../media/vr59wkix.jpg)

	{: .note }
	> A new **Action** node will be added.
	>
	> If the flow requires an input, it requests the value to be selected. The flow you created in the previous steps requires the **TicketNumber** input. Therefore, we need to add this input into the Power Automate action by selecting the variable containing the value from the user, which is **TicketNumber** from earlier in the lab.

	{: .warning }
	> If you don't see the flow you created, **Save** the topic, refresh the page, then try again.
-->
1. In the new **Action** node, under **Power Automate inputs**, select the ellipsis **(...)** next to **Enter or select a value**, then select the **TicketNumber** variable.

	![dmk2ex2j.jpg](../../media/dmk2ex2j.jpg)
	
	{: .note }
	> This is now connected to the Power Automate flow, and outputs the result from Power Automate into the **SNTicketInfo** variable.

	{: .important }
	> **Pro tips**: 
	> - If latency is expected from your integration, go the action's properties and add a latency message , for example: `I'm getting these details for you. Hold on...` 
	> - Consider using HTTP requests and connectors directly in Microsoft Copilot Studio to avoid the added latency of invoking and running a cloud flow in Power Automate.

1. As ServiceNow will return the full details of the incident in a **JSON** format, you need to parse it so that Copilot Studio fully understands its content based on its schema.

	Under the **Action** node, select the **+** button, select **Variable Management**, then select **Parse value**.

	![uvkwqa17.jpg](../../media/uvkwqa17.jpg)

	{: .note }
	> To parse the JSON you can use the Rest API Explorer in ServiceNow to get the structure of the body, or get the schema from a sample payload. For the exercise, we're providing sample ServiceNow data.

1. Under **Parse value**, select the ellipsis **(...)**, then select the **SNTicketInfo** variable.

	![cqtmqp3c.jpg](../../media/cqtmqp3c.jpg)

1. For **Data type**, select **From sample data** from the dropdown menu.

1. Select **Get schema from sample JSON**.

	![s02aculz.jpg](../../media/s02aculz.jpg)

1. Paste the schema below.

	{: .warning }
	> Use the **Copy** option on the following code block and paste it with **Ctrl+V**, rather than use **Type**.

# Exercise 03: Build and call agent flows from your agent

## Scenario

To further automate responses and reduce response times, Contoso integrates their Copilot agent with existing business workflows.

In this exercise, you'll use agent flows to enable the agent to interact seamlessly with Contoso's backend systems. For example, when customers inquire about service appointments or equipment status, the agent automatically retrieves accurate, real-time data, improving operational efficiency and response accuracy.

## Objectives

In this exercise, you'll create a new topic, add a simple agent flow to retrieve information from an external service, and then display that data back to the user.

After this exercise you'll be able to:

- Understand the basics of agent flows.
- Use Copilot Studio to request data from another data source using agent flows and return the data in a conversational dialog with the end user.


## Duration

Estimated time: 60 minutes

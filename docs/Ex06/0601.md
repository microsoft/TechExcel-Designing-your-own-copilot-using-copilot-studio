# Task 01: Create and test a tool

### Introduction

Using the configured knowledge sources, Contoso's agent needs to perform actions based on user queries to provide a seamless customer experience. This task involves creating an action using generative AI orchestration.

### Success criteria

- You successfully created a tool with the correct inputs and outputs.
- You verified that the agent can use the tool based on user queries.
- You tested the tool by asking relevant questions.

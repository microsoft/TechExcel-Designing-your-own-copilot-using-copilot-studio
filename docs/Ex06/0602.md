# Task 02: Test your action

## Introduction

Once you’ve created an action, you'll need to test it to ensure the agent can perform actions accurately.

## Description

## Success criteria

-   You successfully tested the action by interacting with the agent.
-   You verified that the agent performs the action accurately based on user queries.
-   You observed and documented the agent's behavior.
